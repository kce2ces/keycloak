# Governance Reference

This Keycloak IAM system operates under the authority of:

WSI Governance Canon v1.1  
https://github.com/kce2ces/wsi-governance

All identity configurations, realm definitions, roles, policies,
automations, and AI-assisted behaviors within this system
must derive from and comply with the Canon
and its Governance Derivation Contract.

In case of conflict, the Canon prevails.
